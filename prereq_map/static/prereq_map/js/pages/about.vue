          Discover courses and plan your schedule more effectively

        <p class="font-weight-lighter">
          It can be tough figuring out which courses to take. How do you find
          courses similar to ones you’ve really enjoyed? Of the courses you’ve
          already taken, which ones provide a foundation for more advanced
          coursework? What sequence of courses is best? The
          <strong>Prereq Map</strong> helps you discover interesting courses and
          enables you to be strategic about planning your course schedule. (What’s a
          prereq? Prereq is short for prerequisites: the courses that act as a
          foundation for other courses.)
